	* HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is a language used for building and constructing
	components within a website. A website usually contains a set of subpages, and each subpage has
	its own HTML file.
	
	* HTML is not a programming language, which means it cannot execute dynamic functions. To make it
	easier to understand, HTML is similar to MS Word - it is only used to lay out and format content
	on a website. When combined with CSS and JavaScript, HTML becomes the foundation of the web.
	
	* HyperText refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either with a single website or
	between websites. Links are fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the internet and
	linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.
